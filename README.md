node-red-contrib-image-tools
============================

A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node to perform functions on images and decode 2D barcodes.

Pre-requesites
--------------

None! However some of the examples make use of [node-red-contrib-image-output](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-image-output) for visualising operations directly in the flow.

Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install.
Usually this is `~/.node-red` or `%userprofile%\.node-red`.

    npm install node-red-contrib-image-tools 

Alternatively, install from a folder

    npm install c:/tempfolder/node-red-contrib-image-tools


NOTES
-----
* Tested on Node V 10 only. YMMV
* Image Node doesn't show in IE11 (working on it)
* Bugs are likely :)


TODO
----
* Add functions to permit writing text on to an image
* Add functions to get and set pixels
* Improve the readme (add images and sample flows)
